## 2. Array of Random Integers (N < 100)  
Fill an array with random integers and find the maximum and minimum values. Display the array in a single line.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in thee.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/thee.c)

---

## 3. Flip an Array (N < 1000)  
Fill an array with random integers and reverse its contents using a single array. Display both the source and the result.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in four.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/four.c)

---

## 4. Square Matrix Diagonal Sums (N < 10)  
Fill an N×N matrix with integers, then display the matrix and the sums of the main and side diagonals.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in five.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/five.c)

---

## 5. Fibonacci Sequence (N < 50)  
Print the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in six.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/six.c)

---

## 6. Fill Matrix Row-wise (N < 10)  
Fill an N×N matrix with consecutive integers starting from the upper-left corner and proceeding row by row.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in seven.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/seven.c)

---

## 7. Word Count (Single Space Separator)  
Enter a string from the keyboard and count the number of words, assuming words are separated by a single space.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in eight.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/eight.c)

---

## 8. Word Count (Spaces and Punctuation)  
Enter a string from the keyboard and count the number of words, assuming separation by spaces and punctuation marks.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in nine_gilte.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/nine_gitle.c)

---

## 9. Find the Longest Word  
Enter a string of words separated by spaces. Find and display the longest word (do not handle multiple longest words).  
📁 Code: [`Solution in ten.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/ten.c)

---

## 10. Palindrome Check  
Enter a string and check if it is a palindrome.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in eleven.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/eleven.c)

---

## 11. Letter Case Count  
Count the number of lowercase and uppercase English letters in the entered string.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in twelve.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/twelve.c)

---

## 12. Bracket Validation  
Validate a string containing brackets to ensure they are properly closed and not incorrectly nested.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in thirteen.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/thirteen.c)

---

## 13. Word Search and Count  
Enter a string of words and a single word, then determine how many times the word appears in the string.  
📁 Code: [`Solution in last.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/practice_c/blob/main/last.c)
